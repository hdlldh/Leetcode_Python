#You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where: 
#
# 
# Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely. 
# Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through. 
# Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through. 
# 
#
# Example: 
#
# 
#Input: [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
#
#1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
#|   |   |   |   |
#0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
#|   |   |   |   |
#0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0
#
#Output: 7 
#
#Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2),
#             the point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total 
#Â             travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7. 
#
# Note: 
#There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such house according to the above rules, return -1.
