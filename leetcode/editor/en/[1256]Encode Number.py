# Given a non-negative integer num, Return its encoding string. 
# 
#  The encoding is done by converting the integer to a string using a secret fun
# ction that you should deduce from the following table: 
# 
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: num = 23
# Output: "1000"
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: num = 107
# Output: "101100"
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  0 <= num <= 10^9
