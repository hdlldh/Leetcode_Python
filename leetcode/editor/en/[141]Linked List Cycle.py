#Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it. 
#
# To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list. 
#
# 
#
# 
# Example 1: 
#
# 
#Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
#Output: true
#Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
# 
# 
#
# 
# 
#
# Example 2: 
#
# 
#Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
#Output: true
#Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
# 
# 
#
# 
# 
#
# Example 3: 
#
# 
#Input: head = [1], pos = -1
#Output: false
#Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
