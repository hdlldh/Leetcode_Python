# Given a matrix mat where every row is sorted in increasing order, return the s
# mallest common element in all rows. 
# 
#  If there is no common element, return -1. 
# 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  Input: mat = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,4,5,8,10],[3,5,7,9,11],[1,3,5,7,9]]
# Output: 5
#  
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= mat.length, mat[i].length <= 500 
#  1 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^4 
#  mat[i] is sorted in increasing order.
