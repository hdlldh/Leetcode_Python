#Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. 
#
# Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity. 
#
# Example: 
#
# 
#Input:Â [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
#Output: 4
#Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
