#Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive. 
#Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive. 
#
# Note: 
#A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that. 
#
# Example: 
#
# 
#Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
#Output: 3 
#Explanation: The three ranges are : [0,0], [2,2], [0,2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
