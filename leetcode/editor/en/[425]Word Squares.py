# Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares you can build
#  from them. 
# 
#  A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read 
# the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns). 
# 
#  For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word squ
# are because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically. 
# 
#  
# b a l l
# a r e a
# l e a d
# l a d y
#  
# 
#  Note: 
#  
#  There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words. 
#  All words will have the exact same length. 
#  Word length is at least 1 and at most 5. 
#  Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z. 
#  
#  
# 
#  Example 1:
#  
# Input:
# ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]
# 
# Output:
# [
#   [ "wall",
#     "area",
#     "lead",
#     "lady"
#   ],
#   [ "ball",
#     "area",
#     "lead",
#     "lady"
#   ]
# ]
# 
# Explanation:
# The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (
# just the order of words in each word square matters).
#  
#  
# 
#  Example 2:
#  
# Input:
# ["abat","baba","atan","atal"]
# 
# Output:
# [
#   [ "baba",
#     "abat",
#     "baba",
#     "atan"
#   ],
#   [ "baba",
#     "abat",
#     "baba",
#     "atal"
#   ]
# ]
