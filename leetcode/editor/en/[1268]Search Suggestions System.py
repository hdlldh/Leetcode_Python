# Given an array of strings products and a string searchWord. We want to design 
# a system that suggests at most three product names from products after each char
# acter of searchWord is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with 
# the searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix retur
# n the three lexicographically minimums products. 
# 
#  Return list of lists of the suggested products after each character of search
# Word is typed. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWo
# rd = "mouse"
# Output: [
# ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
# ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
# ["mouse","mousepad"],
# ["mouse","mousepad"],
# ["mouse","mousepad"]
# ]
# Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor
# ","mouse","mousepad"]
# After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot"
# ,"monitor"]
# After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
# Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: products = ["bags","baggage","banner","box","cloths"], searchWord = "ba
# gs"
# Output: [["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","b
# ags"],["bags"]]
#  
# 
#  Example 4: 
# 
#  
# Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "tatiana"
# Output: [[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= products.length <= 1000 
#  There are no repeated elements in products. 
#  1 <= Î£ products[i].length <= 2 * 10^4 
#  All characters of products[i] are lower-case English letters. 
#  1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000 
#  All characters of searchWord are lower-case English letters.
