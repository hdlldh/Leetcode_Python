# Given a blacklist B containing unique integers from [0, N), write a function t
# o return a uniform random integer from [0, N) which is NOT in B. 
# 
#  Optimize it such that it minimizes the call to systemâ€™s Math.random(). 
# 
#  Note: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= N <= 1000000000 
#  0 <= B.length < min(100000, N) 
#  [0, N) does NOT include N. See interval notation. 
#  
# 
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: 
# ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
# [[1,[]],[],[],[]]
# Output: [null,0,0,0]
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: 
# ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
# [[2,[]],[],[],[]]
# Output: [null,1,1,1]
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: 
# ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
# [[3,[1]],[],[],[]]
# Output: [null,0,0,2]
#  
# 
#  Example 4: 
# 
#  
# Input: 
# ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
# [[4,[2]],[],[],[]]
# Output: [null,1,3,1]
#  
# 
#  Explanation of Input Syntax: 
# 
#  The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution'
# s constructor has two arguments, N and the blacklist B. pick has no arguments. A
# rguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
